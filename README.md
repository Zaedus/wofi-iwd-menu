# wofi-iwd-menu
This repository contains a simple script for managing a [wofi](https://hg.sr.ht/~scoopta/wofi)-based menu that can control WiFi connections via [iwd](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Iwd). This is a port of [Zach Baylin](https://github.com/zbaylin)'s work on [rofi-wifi-menu](https://github.com/zbaylin/rofi-wifi-menu) which borrows heavily from the source material. This is a fork of [TimTinker's rofi-iwd-menu](https://github.com/TimTinkers/rofi-iwd-menu) with very minor changes to use wofi instead of rofi.

## Usage
Download and run the `wofi-wifi-menu.sh` script.

## Special Thanks
Special thanks is owed to the following organizations, projects, and people without whose work this repository would not be possible.
- [TimTinkers](https://github.com/TimTinkers) because this is basically all of his work with 5 mins of changes on my part.
- [Zach Baylin](https://github.com/zbaylin) whose [rofi-wifi-menu](https://github.com/zbaylin/rofi-wifi-menu) served as a foundation.
- all of the diligent maintainers of the [Arch Linux Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/), the greatest learning resource I've ever found in customizing my system.
